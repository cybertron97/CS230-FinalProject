# CS230-FinalProject
2D interactive python game

This project was created for CS230: Advanced Computer Graphics.
It involves 2D Rigid Body Simulations within the context of an
interactive game. Currently, the simulation only accounts for
the following physical properties:

   1. Linear velocity
   2. Gravity
   3. Collisions (with ground)

Requirements/dependencies:
Python arcade
tkinter

This project is still a work in progress.
